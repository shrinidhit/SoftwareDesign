I found that the process of randomizing the sequence of dna to find the longest gene can produce varied responses even when it is randomized for a large amount(1500) each time. When I ran longest_ORF, I found genes ranging from 200 to 500 nucleotides long. As a result, not all the genes that result are true genes. I noticed that when I put many of my genes through protein BLAST, it wasn't recognized to code for a specific protein. If the threshold is set high, the program recognizes long genes well but may miss other genes. If the threshold is set low, many non-genes are included in the return sequence. Depending on which error is more dangerous, the threshold can be adjusted to favor on or the other in biological research.
